## Context - Mail slow-downs at the USPS

> "The United States Postal Service (USPS) saw a severe decline in the rate of on-time delivery of first-class mail after Louis DeJoy took over as postmaster general." - The Guardian

* 57 policy changes in June and July to reduce costs
    * Eliminate late and extra trips
    * ["No analysis of the service impacts of these various changes was conducted and documentation and guidance to the field for these strategies was very limited and almost exclusively oral."](https://www.uspsoig.gov/document/operational-changes-mail-delivery) - USPS Office of Inspector General report to Congress

## "Revealed: evidence shows huge mail slowdowns after Trump ally took over" - The Guardian

```{r, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("guardian_graphic.png")
```

## Questions

* Which districts were most effected by policy changes?
* How did performance change after September 5^th^

## USPS performance data

```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("ex_page.png")
```

## Extract data with tabulizer::extract_tables()

```{r}
mail %>% head(10) %>% knitr::kable()
```

## Performance below goal, increased variability

```{r plot_national}
mail %>%
  filter(mail_type == "first class") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = nat_average), size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = area_average, col = area), alpha = 0.5, size = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = start_changes) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = suspend_changes) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = last_guardian, linetype = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 93, linetype = 2, size = 1.5) +
  ylim(0, 100) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of first class mail delivered on time",
       caption = "Horizontal dashed line denotes USPS performance goal\nPolicy changes in effect between solid lines\nNew data after dashed line",
       y = "Percentage of mail delivered on time",
       col = "Area")
```

<!-- ## But, there is spatial variation in mail performance -->

<!-- ```{r plot_by_district} -->
<!-- mail %>%  -->

<!--   ggplot() + -->
<!--   geom_line(aes(x = date, y = pct_on_time, group = district)) + -->
<!--   geom_vline(xintercept = start_changes) + -->
<!--   geom_vline(xintercept = suspend_changes) + -->
<!--   geom_vline(xintercept = last_guardian, linetype = 2) + -->
<!--   geom_hline(yintercept = 93, linetype = 2, col = "red") + -->
<!--   ylim(0, 100) + -->
<!--   labs(title = "Percentage of first class mail delivered on time", -->
<!--        caption = "Horizontal dashed line denotes USPS performance goal\nPolicy changes in effect between solid lines\nNew data after dashed line", -->
<!--        y = "Percentage of mail delivered on time", -->
<!--        col = "Area") + -->
<!--     facet_wrap(~area) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Where was mail performance < 70 %

```{r}
# did mail performance drop below
perf_thresh <- 70
bad_performance <-
  mail %>% 
  filter(mail_type == "first class") %>%
  group_by(district) %>%
  mutate(bad = pct_on_time < perf_thresh) %>%
  filter(bad) %>%
  pull(district) %>% unique()

mail %>% filter(district %in% bad_performance, mail_type == "first class") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = nat_average), size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = pct_on_time, group = district, col = district), size = 1) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = start_changes) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = suspend_changes) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = last_guardian, linetype = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 93, linetype = 2, col = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~area) +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  ylim(0, y_upr) +
  labs(title = "Percent of first class mail delivered on time",
       caption = "Horizontal dashed line denotes USPS performance goal\nPolicy changes in effect between solid lines\nNew data after dashed line",
       y = "Percentage of mail delivered on time")
```

## Conclusion

* Yes, performance dropped during policy change
    * Some districts recovered, others declined again
    * Greater variability in performance this Fall
* Other factors besides policy affected performance
    * COVID-19
    * Something else?
